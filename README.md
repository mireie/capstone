# Capstone Proposal
**Name of Student**: Michael Reiersgaard

**Name of Project**: ElevenPDX Musicalendar

**Project's Purpose or Goal**: Allow users to find shows and their details at local venues in one location online. 

**List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:**

- CRUD for venues and shows
- Interactive map that can display venues and shows at those venues
- Filters for show genres, all ages

**What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to *your* track, and *your* language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.**

- Ruby on Rails
- For mapping: [https://leafletjs.com/](https://leafletjs.com/)

**If you finish developing the [minimum viable product (MVP)](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/the-minimum-viable-product) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.**

- Public API
- User Accounts for Venues
- Custom map image

**What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?**

- None!

**Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?**

My goal is to use this as a feature on [https://elevenpdx.com](https://elevenpdx.com) (a WordPress site that I 'built'). We have this in the print version of the magazine and I've always thought a digital version would be really helpful. Here's an example: [https://issuu.com/elevenpdx/docs/eleven-100-fhr/10](https://issuu.com/elevenpdx/docs/eleven-100-fhr/10)
